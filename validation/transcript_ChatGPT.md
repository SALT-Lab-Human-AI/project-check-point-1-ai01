### **Match Summary (45%)**

Mary Smith‚Äôs profile shows a **moderate foundational fit** for the Data Management Analyst role, primarily due to her **strong educational background in Computer Science** and **early exposure to IT-related work**. However, her experience and technical skill set are **not yet aligned with the specialized requirements** of the position, such as **SQL-based data integration, CRM systems, .NET development, and large-scale data handling**.

To move closer to this type of role, Mary could consider:

* **Gaining hands-on experience** with data tools such as **MS SQL, SSIS, and Visual Studio**.
* **Completing a short course or certification** in **data management or CRM systems** (e.g., Salesforce, Blackbaud).
* **Building small-scale data integration projects** or **SQL-based dashboards** to demonstrate practical skills.

With these targeted improvements, she could strengthen her profile and **significantly increase her compatibility** with data-focused analyst positions in the near future.

* Emphasize transferable skills: data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and cross-department collaboration.
* Learn or highlight any exposure to SQL, SSIS, or CRM-related data tools.
* Mention experience documenting data processes or workflow automation in academic or work projects.

**Summary of Match Result (64% Match)**

Jeo Kim‚Äôs background demonstrates a **solid academic foundation in data and information sciences** and **hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and process documentation**. His experience managing large datasets, conducting statistical analysis in Python and SPSS, and collaborating across multiple university organizations reflects strong analytical and teamwork capabilities ‚Äî both valuable for data management roles.

However, the match is **moderate (64%)** because the role places heavy emphasis on **technical tools and platforms** such as SQL, SSIS, .NET, Visual Studio, and particularly **Blackbaud CRM**, which are not currently reflected in Jeo‚Äôs experience. Strengthening proficiency in these enterprise data integration tools and emphasizing familiarity with **CRM systems, SQL-based workflows, or data pipeline development** would substantially improve alignment.

In summary, Jeo appears **well-prepared for entry-level or trainee data management roles** and could become a stronger candidate for this position with **targeted upskilling in CRM data systems, SQL programming, and data integration frameworks**.

**Match Score: 50% ‚Äî Moderate Alignment**

**Summary:**
The resume demonstrates a strong analytical foundation and familiarity with data handling using tools like Python and SQL, which are valuable for data-driven roles. However, this position emphasizes **data integration, system-level development, and CRM data management**‚Äîareas where the candidate‚Äôs experience is limited. The resume aligns well with the analytical mindset and problem-solving aspects of the role but lacks direct exposure to **integration technologies (SSIS, VB .Net, APIs, and Blackbaud CRM)** that are central to this position.

**Suggestion:**
To strengthen alignment, the candidate could:

* Gain hands-on experience with **ETL or data integration tools** (e.g., SSIS, Talend, or Informatica).
* Explore **CRM systems** like Blackbaud or Salesforce to understand data quality and integration workflows.
* Build familiarity with **.Net or Visual Studio environments** for implementing and maintaining integration processes.
* Highlight any experience with **data validation, documentation, or collaboration across teams**, which directly supports the job‚Äôs data quality and coordination aspects.

With these skill enhancements, the candidate could move from a moderate to a **high match** for data integration or data management-focused developer roles.
