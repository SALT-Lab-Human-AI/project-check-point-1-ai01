Here‚Äôs a concise, suggestive summary based on the **45% match score**:

### **Match Summary (45%)**

Mary Smith‚Äôs profile shows a **moderate foundational fit** for the Data Management Analyst role, primarily due to her **strong educational background in Computer Science** and **early exposure to IT-related work**. However, her experience and technical skill set are **not yet aligned with the specialized requirements** of the position, such as **SQL-based data integration, CRM systems, .NET development, and large-scale data handling**.

To move closer to this type of role, Mary could consider:

* **Gaining hands-on experience** with data tools such as **MS SQL, SSIS, and Visual Studio**.
* **Completing a short course or certification** in **data management or CRM systems** (e.g., Salesforce, Blackbaud).
* **Building small-scale data integration projects** or **SQL-based dashboards** to demonstrate practical skills.

With these targeted improvements, she could strengthen her profile and **significantly increase her compatibility** with data-focused analyst positions in the near future.
