## Opportunity framing Validation
- Most ATS systems we found in the checkpoint 1 are multi-functional, not only doing resume screening but also job posting, interview scheduling, etc. Some ATS like HireVue even utilize AI capabilities in hiring process, letting AI to scoring test game as part of the interview process and boost overall hiring process.
- On the other hand, our project is more focused on making a decision based on resume by providing matching score between job description and resume. This is a more specific task compared to the general ATS systems.
- Therefore, one of specific requirements for our project is to provide explainability of the matching score, letting users know why they get this score and how to improve it. For example, instead of just giving a score of 6/10, the system should also provide feedback like "You have strong experience in project management, but your technical skills in Python are lacking compared to the job requirements."
