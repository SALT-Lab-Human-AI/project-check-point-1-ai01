##  NLP-Based Bi-Directional Recommendation System: Towards Recommending Jobs to Job Seekers and Resumes to Recruiters 

Alsaif, S., Hidri, M. S., Ferjani, I., Eleraky, H. A., & Hidri, A. (2022). NLP-Based Bi-Directional Recommendation System: Towards Recommending Jobs to Job Seekers and Resumes to Recruiters. Big Data Cogn. Comput., 6, 147. Retrieved from https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:254198842

### Summary (4–6 sentences):  
- The paper proposes an NLP-based bi-directional recommender system designed to match job seekers with relevant job postings and simultaneously suggest suitable candidates to recruiters. Unlike traditional keyword or information retrieval approaches, the system uses advanced text preprocessing, word embeddings, and similarity scoring to improve matching accuracy between resumes and job descriptions. Data was collected through web scraping of job postings in Saudi Arabia and annotated resumes, then processed using spaCy for named entity recognition (NER) to extract skills, education, and location. Evaluation results showed strong accuracy and precision across most job categories, with an overall accuracy of 80%.

Insights:
- Bi-directional focus: The system benefits both job seekers and recruiters by recommending jobs to candidates and resumes to employers, tackling inefficiencies on both ends of the hiring pipeline.

- NER and embeddings: Using NER (spaCy) and word embeddings (Word2Vec + cosine similarity) effectively captures structured entities like skills and education, enabling more accurate matching.

- Real-world applicability: The approach showed high performance even with overlapping skills between roles (e.g., Data Scientist vs. Data Engineer), demonstrating practical value for complex labor markets.

Limitations / Risks:
- Dataset limitations: The study relied on a relatively small set of resumes (138 for training, 25 for testing), which may not generalize well across industries or larger, more diverse labor markets.
- Contextual blind spots: The model does not yet consider factors like experience, career progression, or soft skills, which are often critical in recruitment decisions.

Idea for our project:
- Recruit AI could utilize the idea of NER to extract structured information from resumes and job descriptions, then using LLM to generate compatibility scores based on these entities, enhancing the accuracy of candidate position analysis.
