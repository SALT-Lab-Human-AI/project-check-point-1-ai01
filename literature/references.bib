  abstract = {The proliferation of Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies impacting entire business sectors is also transforming the field of human resources and recruitment. AI-based recruitment tools are changing the way recruitment processes are conducted. However, the perception of AI technology from the candidate's perspective has received limited coverage in the literature. Since little is known about how applicants experience AI-enabled recruitment, this paper explores their experiences and perceptions in hiring processes. The results of this study show that applicants perceive AI technology positively in hiring processes and see it as useful and easy to use. In terms of advantages, reduced response time was recognized as the most significant benefit. The lack of nuance in human judgment, low accuracy and reliability, and immature technology were identified as the biggest drawbacks of AI in recruitment.}
